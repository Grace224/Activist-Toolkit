    <h4>What is food insecurity?</h4>
    <p class="text">The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion defines food insecurity as "the disruption of food intake or eating patterns because of lack of money and other resources."</p>
    <h4>Why should we care about it?</h4>
    <p class="text"> It is a huge issue for many Americans, 10.5% of us in fact. According to the USDA, more than 38 million people, including 12 million children, in the United States are food insecure. To explain those numbers further, 1 in 6 American children may not know where their next meal is coming from. The pandemic has worsened the situation by increasing food insecurity among families with children and communities of color, who already faced hunger at much higher rates before the pandemic. </p>
    <h4>How we can help!</h4>
    <p class="text">Many households that experience food insecurity do not qualify for federal nutrition programs and visit their local food banks and other food programs for extra support. This is one of the ways you can help. By donating to your local food bank/volunteering at them, you can directly help those in your community that need it.</p>
